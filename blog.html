            <h1>Salmon Zoodles Health Benefits</h1>
    
            <p>Salmon Zoodles is the way to go for those looking for a meal that's packed with flavour. The best part is that it doesn't require a whole lot of ingredients. The main components are salmon, zucchini, and noodles. Aside from those three main ingredients, you can pretty much put whatever seasoning and seasoning to strengthen whichever flavour you find best. 
            </p>
            <p>This dish is an excellent replacement for when you're looking for a healthy balanced meal with carbs, protein, and fats. It comes with many health benefits. Salmon is known for providing a whole lot of protein. It is low in saturated fats and a great source of vitamin B12, potassium, iron, and vitamin D. This can lower the chances of you getting cardiovascular diseases, dementia, Alzheimer's, and some types of cancer. However, like most things, only consume in moderation because too much of something is never good.

            <p>Zucchini, on the other hand, is known to rich in many nutrients and antioxidants. These nutrients promote a healthier immune system and support eyesight. The antioxidants, such as lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene, can be found in zucchini, which lead to protection against certain types of cancers like prostate cancer.

            <p>Depending on the kind of noodles or pasta you decide to make this dish with, different kinds come with additional health benefits. If you want to stick with a healthier type of carb to go with your flavourful protein, go for chickpea pasta or whole wheat noodles. Chickpea pasta and entire wheat noodles provide fibre, which helps with digestion and promotes better bowel movement. It is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and bowel cancer.
