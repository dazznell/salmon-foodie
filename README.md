# Salmon Foodie Website

## Milestone 4


Here are the updates I made to the website:

1. I create a recipe page! This links to different websites that already have the recipes.

1. I create some copywrite for the landing page.


1. I updates the navigation links in order for the user to get to the different pages that the website has.
